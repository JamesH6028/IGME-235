                Throughout my time at RIT I have worked on multiple game projects utilizing different game engines and
                other programs.
            </h4>
            <p>
                The first game I worked on was for a project in my Game Development & Algorithmic Problem Solving class
                during the spring semester of 2025. The game is called "Make Every Day the Last". It's a 2D shooter with
                a top-down perspective in which you progress through three levels of enemies until you reach a final
                boss. The game featured saving progress, allowing players to keep the guns and upgrades they earned
                through gameplay. The game was a collaborative project between myself and three other people, working in
                the MonoGame engine. My work on the project includes all the player/weapon controls (movement, weapon
                orbit, shooting, parrying), shop functionality, the save system, and the creation of several assets.
                Throughout this experience, we ran playtests and incorporated feedback from testers in order to
                strengthen the game's functionality.
            </p>

                A game I just recently worked on is a 2D top-down perspective survival horror game called "". The game
                has the player trapped in a dark minseshaft with an angry monster hunting them down. In order to survive
                this monster, the player can hide in hinding spots scattered across the map. They can also find salt and
                place it at spots around the mineshaft to block the monster's path. They can also light lanterns along
                the way to make vision easier. For this project, my group worked with the Unity engine and utilized
                GitHub for version control. My work on the project includes the implementation and functionality of the
                lanterns and the salt placeables and collectibles and how the player interacts with all of these.

            <h2>Current Plans</h2>
            "" is actually a project for itch.io's 2025 Scream Jam, a week long game jam with a horror theme. The time
            frame for this game jam ended up conflicting with other priorities for everyone in the group, so all of the
            work for this project was done within the last 48 hours. Because we really only had this short frame of time
            to work on this project, we have plans to add a little more to the game in the near future

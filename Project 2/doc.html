    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>My process for this project was to get functionality working first. <br>
        I wanted to ensure that every feature was working, testing until it was right. <br>
        Once the functionality of the website was in place, I began to implement the css, <br>
        trying out different ways of displaying items and making adjustments until I was <br>
        at a place I liked.
    </p>

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>For tutorials on javascript and css, I used W3C Schools and Stack Overflow.</p>
    <p>The images I have saved manually come from the PokeAPI.</p>

    <h2>Special Features</h2>
    <p>The only effort I want to make aware is how the search term gets fixed. <br>
        The API has a specific way that it wants names to be written, otherwise it throws an error.<br>
        I added some code so that so long as the name is spelled right, the pokemon will be found.</p>
    <p>I do want to note that for some reason the type images refuse to load right away. If the page is <br>
    refreshed this issue is fixed. I cannot figure out why this issue happens.</p>

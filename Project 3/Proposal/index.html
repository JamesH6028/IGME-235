            <h2>High Concept</h2>
            <p>In a world ravaged by war and decay, one man in a robot body rises to challenge the tyrannical machine
                overlords. “Robo Revolt” is a 2D platformer where precision shooting and constant movement are your keys
                to survival.</p>

            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>The game follows John Smith, a former military sergeant whose consciousness has been transfered into a
                robot body. With humanity nearly extinct and the world ruled by corrupted AI factions, Smith must
                traverse the ruins of civilization to dismantle the central AI core and restore balance.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>The visual style draws from rusted metal, broken circuitry, and scorched earth tones. Think pixel art
                with heavy shadows, flickering neon signs, and crumbling industrial backdrops. The UI uses distressed
                textures and glitch effects to reinforce the post-apocalyptic theme.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>Players control Smith using keyboard and mouse controls to run, jump, and shoot. Controls are given at
                the start of the game, but the player
                will learn through trial and error. As a stretch goal I would like to have upgrade choices the player
                can get that increases their capabilities.

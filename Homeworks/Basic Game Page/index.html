        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <em>The Gang</em> is a 3 - 6 player co-operative version of Texas Hold'em poker in which players <br>
            try to order their hands in strength. Each round, players choose a chip with numbers 1 to the amount <br>
            of players based on how good they feel about their hand. This repeats for the flop, turn and river. <br>
            If the players successfully ordered themselves, they open a vault, but if they fail they trip an alarm. <br>
            The game ends when players either successfully open three vaults or fail and trip three alarms.

    <h2>Review Quote</h2>
    <blockquote>
        The free-for-all tempo of placing the ranking chips in front of you without being able to verbally <br>
        communicate your hand strength is where this game really shines! If, for example, someone takes the <br>
        highest value chip instantly or if two people steal the 1-star chip from each other, it's up to the <br>
        group to understand what they think that means without actually giving any information away. <br>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <em>The Gang</em> is a 3 - 6 player co-operative version of Texas Hold'em poker in which players <br>
        try to order their hands in strength. Each round, players choose a chip with numbers 1 to the amount <br>
        of players based on how good they feel about their hand. This repeats for the flop, turn and river. <br>
        If the players successfully ordered themselves, they open a vault, but if they fail they trip an alarm. <br>
        The game ends when players either successfully open three vaults or fail and trip three alarms.

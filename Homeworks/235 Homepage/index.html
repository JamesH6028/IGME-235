                Hey There! My name is James. I'm a second year Game Design & Development major here at RIT.
                I love cooking, listening to metal music, and watching football (Go Bills). From this class I hope
                to gain some web development experience so I can make a website for myself and one for my mom.
                At RIT I want to make connections with people with industry experience for my future. I'm hoping to
                end up working in the game development industry or a related field, and maybe even publish my 
                own game.
            </p>
